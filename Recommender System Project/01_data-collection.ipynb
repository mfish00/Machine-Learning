    "## 1. MovieLens Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages data by GroupLens (available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The data is divided into multiple tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    movieId,title,genres\n",
    "\n",
    "* Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following: Action, Adventure, Animation, Children's, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film-Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western, (no genres listed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Links Data File Structure (links.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n",
    "\n",
    "* movieId is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* imdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. TMDB Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The information contained in the movies.csv dataset by GroupLens does not provide sufficient information on movies to build a sound content-based recommender system. Therefore, we collect additional data on the movies by retrieving additional information on each movie from the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 'collection_name': The name of the collection the movie is part of (NaN-values are not part of any collection)\n",
    "   * 'original_language': The original language of the movie.\n",
    "   * 'description': A short description of the movie plot.\n",
    "   * 'runtime': The duration of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "   * 'actors': A list containing the top 3 most popular actors starring in the movie according to the popularity index by TMDB.\n",
    "   * 'director': The director(s) of the movie.\n",
    "   * 'production_countries': The countries in which the movie has been produced.\n",
    "   * 'spoken_languages': A list of the languages spoken in the movie."
